## About me

Father of 2, I live in Orleans in the centre of France

I regularly travel to sunny and friendly Philippines

I'm passionate about technology. I fell into web development around 20 years ago when I was in high-school and computers had 56K modems. I also loved programming on my Ti-83 calculator then.

I don't have many hobbies, but I follow Formula 1 and my football team Auxerre. I like going for a run too.
